# Notification Sound

To enable notification sounds, add a notification sound file named `notification.mp3` to this directory.

You can:
1. Download a free notification sound from websites like:
   - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
   - https://freesound.org/
   - https://notificationsounds.com/

2. Or use a simple beep/ding sound effect

The file should be:
- Named: `notification.mp3`
- Location: `/public/notification.mp3`
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 1-2 seconds recommended
- Volume: Medium (the app will play it at 50% volume)

If no sound file is provided, the notification will still work but without audio.
